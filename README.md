# TwBot

This is a bot for the online browser game tribal wars.

Features:

- Farming barbarian villages with farm assistant
- Farming player villages.
- Upgrading buildings
- Recruiting units

All the above features can be automated in order to be competitive
and not 24/7 active. Just let the bot do its work.

Some things are hardcoded because I was trying to develop the bot
and play at the same time.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `tw_bot` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tw_bot, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/tw_bot>.
